# :art: Processing Sketches
This repo contains all of the sketches I make in Processing. If you want to learn more about Processing, check it out [here](https://processing.org/)

## :memo: How to run sketches
The fastest way to run a sketch is to open a folder in Processing. Install any libraries necessary in the sketch; they can be found as imports at the top of the file containing the setup() function. You can then press the play button and watch the magic on your screen! :sparkles:

If you want to set up Processing in VSCode, I recommend the following tutorials: [Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKuu-WcOZYA) / [Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlVFRzX6jtE)
